            <h2 id="profProfile">Professional Profile</h2>

            <p>I am a Technical Team Leader for a large application develoment services provider in the Government Sector working on a Social Services project in Olympia, WA.  I have behind me more than twenty-six years of experience in mainframe applications development, mainframe application maintenance, and end-user support.</p> 

            <p>I currently function as the Development Team Leader for a Data Collection team.  This role provides direction, instructions and guidance to the application team for their deliverables, day to day operations and application maintenance. This role is accountable for the team's deliverables (Problem Report solutions, Change Requests and Projects) across all stages of the product life cycle while ensuring on-time and in-budget delivery of quality code. </p>

            <p>Prior to my current role, I was responsible for maintaining a series of data collection applications as well as system support activities at a customer location.  I am able to work independently or in a team environment, throughout all phases of a project’s life cycle.</p>

        <h2 id="student">Student Aspirations</h2>

        <p>As a student at Code Fellows, I wish to expand my skills as a developer into the Web domain.  

        <p>Eventually I wish to use these skills in one of two ways:
        If my current client decides to renew my company’s contract, the ability to more effectively interpret and review the code of my developers would greatly enhance my value as a development lead.
        Should my current contract decline to renew my company’s contract, I would have the ability to find employment elsewhere, either as a developer or as a technical lead in another area.</p>
